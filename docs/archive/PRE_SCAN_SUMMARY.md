## 🔧 Today's Fixes

### 1. Series Card Fix ✅
**Problem**: When scanning "Killing Floor", it showed "You Have 1 Books" (including the current scan)

**Fix**: Modified `ScannerReviewView.swift:1507` to exclude current book from count
```swift
book.seriesName == seriesName && book.isbn != eval.isbn
```

**Result**: Now correctly shows only books already in your collection

---

### 2. Better Scan Retry Logic ✅
**Problem**: Scans would timeout too quickly

**Fix**: Increased retries from 3 to 5 with better feedback (2s, 3s, 4s, 5s, 6s delays)

**Result**: More reliable scans with progress indicators

---

### 3. Comprehensive Test Suite ✅
**Created**:
- `tests/pre_scan_validation.py` - Backend API validation (15/16 pass)
- `tests/ios_api_integration_test.py` - iOS API endpoint testing
- `tests/ios_workflow_checklist.md` - Manual testing checklist

## 🚀 Starting the Backend

**Before scanning, ensure backend is running**:

```bash
cd /Users/nickcuskey/ISBN
python3 -m uvicorn isbn_web.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

**Verify it's running**:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
# Should return: {"status":"healthy"}
```

**Check processes**:
```bash
lsof -ti:8000  # Should show process ID
```

**If backend is unresponsive, restart it**:
```bash
lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill -9
python3 -m uvicorn isbn_web.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

## 📊 Current Collection Status

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| **Total Books** | 749 |
| **Total Lots** | 174 |
| **Series Lots** | 56 |
| **Author Lots** | 117 |
| **Estimated Value** | Variable per lot |

**Example Series Lot**:
- **Jack Reacher Series**: 6/30 books (20% complete)
  - Killing Floor ($11.75)
  - Die Trying ($10.00)
  - Echo Burning ($10.00)

## ⚡ Performance Benchmarks

| Operation | Time | Status |
|-----------|------|--------|
| Health check | 0.002s | ✅ Excellent |
| Cached book lookup | 0.002s | ✅ Excellent |
| Books list load | 0.143s | ✅ Fast |
| Lots list load | 0.142s | ✅ Fast |
| New book scan | 10-30s | ⚠️ Acceptable |

**Note**: New book scans are slower because they query multiple external APIs (BookScouter, eBay, Amazon). Cached lookups are nearly instant.

---

## 🔍 Known Issues (Non-Critical)

### 1. Stats Endpoint Display Bug
**Issue**: `/api/books/stats` returns `book_count: 0, lot_count: 0`

**Impact**: Low - Display bug only, actual data is fine

**Workaround**: Use `/api/books/all` instead (works perfectly)

---

### 2. Scan Speed
**Issue**: New book evaluations take 10-30 seconds

**Cause**: Sequential API calls to multiple services:
- BookScouter metadata (2-5s)
- eBay Browse + Sold Comps (3-10s)
- BooksRun offers (1-3s)
- BookScouter vendor offers (2-5s)

**Attempted Fix**: Tried parallelization but caused session threading issues

**Current Status**: Sequential is stable and reliable

**Impact**: Acceptable for book sales - you'll have time to evaluate each book

## 🎯 Quick Pre-Scan Checklist

Before going to the book sale:

- [ ] Backend server is running (`curl http://localhost:8000/health`)
- [ ] Run validation tests (`python3 tests/pre_scan_validation.py`)
- [ ] Open iOS app and check all 4 tabs load
- [ ] Test scan with a book from home
- [ ] Verify series detection works
- [ ] Check iPhone battery (>50%)
- [ ] Have mobile hotspot or WiFi access plan
- [ ] Bookmark backend restart command (in case needed)

## 🆘 Emergency Troubleshooting

### Backend Won't Start
```bash
# Kill any stuck processes
lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill -9

# Wait a moment
sleep 3

# Start fresh
cd /Users/nickcuskey/ISBN
python3 -m uvicorn isbn_web.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

### iOS App Won't Connect
1. Check Settings tab → Backend URL should be correct
2. Test backend: `curl http://localhost:8000/health`
3. Check firewall settings
4. Try restarting the app

### Scans Timing Out
1. Check backend logs: `tail -f ~/.isbn_lot_optimizer/activity.log`
2. Verify APIs are responding
3. Check internet connection
4. Restart backend if needed

### Series Not Detecting
1. Check book has series metadata
2. Refresh lots (pull to refresh in Lots tab)
3. Check series files exist: `ls -lh ~/.isbn_lot_optimizer/series_*.json`
