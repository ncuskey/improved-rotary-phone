# eBay API Integration - Fixed & Functional

**Date**: October 29, 2025
**Status**: ✓ Working (Track B - Estimates)

---

## Issue Diagnosis

### Original Problem

`get_sold_comps()` was returning `None` when called by the POC collector script, blocking fresh data collection from eBay.

### Root Causes Found

1. **Environment variables not loaded** - POC collector script wasn't loading `.env` file
2. **Data structure mismatch** - POC collector expected object attributes, `get_sold_comps()` returns dict
3. **Track A (Marketplace Insights) not available** - eBay MI API requires approval

### Investigation Steps

1. Tested token broker (http://localhost:8787) - ✓ Running
2. Tested `/sold/ebay` endpoint - Returns HTTP 501 (MI not enabled)
3. Tested Track B fallback - ✓ Working when env vars loaded
4. Found env vars in `.env` file - ✓ Present
5. Identified POC script not loading `.env` - ✗ Missing

---

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added Environment Variable Loading

**File**: `scripts/collect_training_data_poc.py`

**Change**: Added .env loading at script startup

```python
# Load environment variables from .env
env_file = Path(__file__).parent.parent / '.env'
if env_file.exists():
    for line in env_file.read_text().splitlines():
        line = line.strip()
        if line and not line.startswith('#') and '=' in line:
            key, value = line.split('=', 1)
            os.environ[key] = value.strip('"').strip("'")
```

**Why needed**: eBay Browse API requires `EBAY_CLIENT_ID` and `EBAY_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables

### 2. Fixed Data Structure Handling

**File**: `scripts/collect_training_data_poc.py` - `check_sold_comps()` method

**Before** (Broken):
```python
market_stats = get_sold_comps(isbn)
if not market_stats or not market_stats.sold_count:  # ✗ Expects object attributes
    return False, None
```

**After** (Fixed):
```python
market_stats = get_sold_comps(isbn)
if not market_stats or not market_stats.get('count'):  # ✓ Works with dict
    return False, None

sold_count = market_stats['count']
market_dict = {
    'sold_count': sold_count,
    'sold_median_price': market_stats.get('median', 0),
    'sold_min_price': market_stats.get('min', 0),
    'sold_max_price': market_stats.get('max', 0),
    'source': market_stats.get('source'),
    'is_estimate': market_stats.get('is_estimate', True),
}
```

## Current eBay API Status

### Track A: Marketplace Insights (Real Sold Data)

**Status**: ❌ Not Available

**Error Message**:
```
eBay Marketplace Insights not enabled on this app.
Apply for access at https://developer.ebay.com/my/keys
```

**What this means**:
- Cannot access real historical sold data from eBay
- Need to apply for Marketplace Insights API access
- Approval process can take days/weeks

### Track B: Estimates from Active Listings

**Status**: ✅ Working

**Test Results**:
```bash
Testing for ISBN: 9780439708180 (Harry Potter)
✓ SUCCESS!
  Count: 4
  Median: $4.49
  Min: $2.99
  Max: $5.99
  Source: estimate
  Is estimate: True
```

**How it works**:
1. Fetches active eBay listings for the ISBN
2. Uses conservative percentiles (25th for Used, median for New)
3. Returns estimated "sold" prices based on active pricing
4. Marks data as `is_estimate: true`

---

## Limitations of Track B (Estimates)

### Compared to Real Sold Data

| Aspect | Track A (Sold Data) | Track B (Estimates) | Impact |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------|--------|
| **Accuracy** | High - actual sales | Lower - assumptions | Estimates may not match real selling prices |
| **Sample size** | Typically 20-50+ | Typically 3-10 | Fewer data points |
| **Recency** | Last 90 days sold | Current active | More current but less proven |
| **Reliability** | Proven market price | Conservative estimate | Training data less certain |

### For Training Data Collection

**What works**:
- Can still collect multi-source data (eBay estimates + Amazon + metadata)
- Estimates are conservative (25th percentile), reducing overestimation
- Better than nothing - provides price signals for model training

**Limitations**:
- Lower sample counts (3-10 vs 10-50 real sold comps)
- May not meet `min_comps: 10` threshold for most books
- Estimates don't capture actual market behavior
- Model trained on estimates may be less accurate

## Testing POC Collector

Now that the fixes are applied, the POC collector should work:

```bash
# Create test ISBN list
cat > /tmp/fresh_test_isbns.txt <<EOF
9780316015844
9781416524793
9780307474278
9780062315007
9780439358071
EOF

# Run POC collector
python3 scripts/collect_training_data_poc.py \
  --category first_edition_hardcover \
  --limit 10 \
  --isbn-file /tmp/fresh_test_isbns.txt
```

**Expected behavior**:
- Environment variables load automatically
- `get_sold_comps()` returns Track B estimates
- Books with 3-10 active listings collected (not all may meet 10+ threshold)
- Data stored in training_data.db with `is_estimate: True`

---

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Use Track B (Current State)

**Pros**:
- Works immediately, no waiting
- Can collect some training data
- Architecture fully functional

**Cons**:
- Lower sample counts
- Estimates, not real sold prices
- May not find enough books meeting 10+ comps threshold

**Recommended action**:
- Test POC collector with Track B estimates
- Lower `min_comps` threshold from 10 to 3-5 temporarily
- Collect what we can with estimates
- Monitor model improvement

### Option 2: Apply for Marketplace Insights API

**Steps**:
1. Go to https://developer.ebay.com/my/keys
2. Select your app ("LotHelper")
3. Request "Marketplace Insights" API access
4. Wait for approval (days to weeks)
5. Once approved, Track A will automatically work
6. Re-collect data with real sold comps (10-50 per book)

**Pros**:
- Get real historical sold data
- 10-50 sold comps per book
- Much better training data quality
- Model accuracy will improve significantly

**Cons**:
- Waiting period for approval
- No immediate data collection

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach

**Recommended**: Do both!

1. **Immediate** (Track B):
   - Lower `min_comps` threshold to 3-5
   - Collect ~50-100 books with Track B estimates
   - Train model and measure improvement
   - Get architecture battle-tested

2. **Future** (Track A):
   - Apply for Marketplace Insights API access
   - Once approved, re-collect with real sold data
   - Replace estimate data with real data
   - Retrain model with much better data

## Updated Target Adjustments

### For Track B (Estimates)

**Modified thresholds**:
```python
CollectionTarget(
    category='signed_hardcover',
    min_comps=3,  # Was: 10 (lowered for estimates)
    target_count=50,  # Was: 200 (reduced for POC)
)
```

**Expected results**:
- Can collect 50-100 books with 3-5 "comps" each
- Model should still improve (more diverse data)
- Not as accurate as real sold data, but better than nothing

### For Track A (Future - Real Sold Data)

**Original thresholds**:
```python
CollectionTarget(
    category='signed_hardcover',
    min_comps=10,  # Real sold comps
    target_count=200,  # Full Priority 1 target
)
```

**Expected results**:
- Can collect 200-400 books with 10-50 comps each
- Much higher quality training data
- Significant model accuracy improvement
- Expected MAE reduction: $3.40 → $3.00-3.20
