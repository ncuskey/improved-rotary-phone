# Scan History with Location Tracking - Implementation Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-23
**Status:** Backend Complete, iOS Integration Pending

## What Was Built

A comprehensive scan history system that tracks every book scan (accepted AND rejected) with optional location data.

### ✅ Completed Components

#### 1. Database Layer (`shared/database.py`)

**New Table:** `scan_history`
- 17 fields including ISBN, decision, book details, and location data
- 4 indexes for fast queries (ISBN, timestamp, decision, location)
- Auto-created on database initialization

**New Methods:**
- `log_scan()` - Log any scan with full details
- `get_scan_history()` - Query with filters (ISBN, location, decision, limit)
- `get_scan_locations()` - Location summaries with acceptance rates
- `get_scan_stats()` - Overall statistics

#### 2. Service Layer (`isbn_lot_optimizer/service.py`)

**New Method:** `BookService.log_scan()`
- Accepts `BookEvaluation` object and logs all relevant data
- Handles location parameters
- Used by both automatic and manual logging

**Auto-logging:**
- `_persist_book()` now automatically logs ACCEPT when books are saved
- Graceful error handling (won't fail book persistence if logging fails)

#### 3. REST API (`isbn_web/api/routes/books.py`)

**New Endpoints:**

1. `POST /api/books/log-scan`
   - Log any scan decision (ACCEPT, REJECT, SKIP, etc.)
   - Accepts full location data
   - Works even if book isn't in catalog yet

2. `GET /api/books/scan-history`
   - Query history with filters
   - Parameters: limit, isbn, location_name, decision

3. `GET /api/books/scan-locations`
   - Summary of all locations visited
   - Shows scan counts and acceptance rates

4. `GET /api/books/scan-stats`
   - Overall statistics
   - Total scans, acceptance rates, date ranges

#### 4. Documentation

- **[SCAN_HISTORY_FEATURE.md](SCAN_HISTORY_FEATURE.md)** - Complete feature guide
  - Database schema
  - API methods
  - REST endpoints with examples
  - Use cases
  - Privacy considerations

## How It Works

### Automatic Logging (ACCEPT)

```python
# User scans a book via GUI, web, or iOS app
evaluation = service.scan_isbn("9780385497466", condition="Good")

# Behind the scenes:
# 1. Book is evaluated and persisted to catalog
# 2. _persist_book() automatically calls log_scan()
# 3. Scan is logged with decision="ACCEPT"
```

### Manual Logging (REJECT/SKIP)

```python
# iOS app sends reject decision
POST /api/books/log-scan
{
  "isbn": "9780385497466",
  "decision": "REJECT",
  "location_name": "Half Price Books Denver",
  "location_latitude": 39.7392,
  "location_longitude": -104.9903,
  "notes": "Price too high"
}
```

### Querying History

```python
# Get all scans at a location
scans = db.get_scan_history(location_name="Half Price Books Denver")

# Get rejected books (might still be there!)
rejects = db.get_scan_history(decision="REJECT", limit=100)

# Check if you've scanned this before
previous = db.get_scan_history(isbn="9780385497466")
```

## Testing Results

All tests passed:

```
✓ Scan a book → Auto-logged as ACCEPT
✓ Query scan history → Returns all scans
✓ Manual REJECT with location → Logged successfully
✓ Get statistics → Accurate counts
✓ Get locations → Correct summaries and rates
```

## Use Cases Now Enabled

### 1. Avoid Rescanning
"You scanned this 2 weeks ago at Store X and rejected it (price too high)"

### 2. Location Intelligence
"Store A: 65% acceptance rate (12/18 scans)"
"Store B: 20% acceptance rate (5/25 scans)"
→ Prioritize Store A for future visits

### 3. Inventory Tracking
"Here are 33 books you rejected at this location - they might still be there!"

### 4. Pattern Analysis
"You accept 63% of thriller books but only 25% of romance"
"Your acceptance rate improves at stores you visit regularly"

## Next Steps: iOS Integration

### Required Changes

#### 1. Add Location Tracking

**Info.plist:**
```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>LotHelper uses your location to remember which stores have which books, helping you avoid rescanning and track productive locations.</string>
```

**LocationManager.swift** (new file):
```swift
import CoreLocation

class LocationManager: NSObject, ObservableObject, CLLocationManagerDelegate {
    private let manager = CLLocationManager()
    @Published var currentLocation: CLLocation?
    @Published var currentLocationName: String?

    override init() {
        super.init()
        manager.delegate = self
        manager.desiredAccuracy = kCLLocationAccuracyHundredMeters
    }

    func requestLocation() {
        manager.requestWhenInUseAuthorization()
        manager.requestLocation()
    }

    // Implement delegate methods
    // Reverse geocode to get location name
}
```

#### 2. Update ScannerReviewView

Add location data to ACCEPT/REJECT API calls:

```swift
// When user taps Accept
Task {
    await BookAPI.logScan(
        isbn: isbn,
        decision: "ACCEPT",
        locationName: locationManager.currentLocationName,
        locationLatitude: locationManager.currentLocation?.coordinate.latitude,
        locationLongitude: locationManager.currentLocation?.coordinate.longitude
    )
}

// When user taps Reject
Task {
    await BookAPI.logScan(
        isbn: isbn,
        decision: "REJECT",
        locationName: locationManager.currentLocationName,
        // ... location data
        notes: "User tapped Don't Buy"
    )
}
```

#### 3. Add Scan History View

New tab or section in Books tab showing:
- Recent scans with decision badges
- Filter by location
- "Scanned X times at Y locations" summary
- Tap to see full history for a book

#### 4. Add "Previously Scanned" Warning

Before showing evaluation, check:
```swift
let history = await BookAPI.getScanHistory(isbn: isbn)
if let lastScan = history.first {
    // Show alert: "You scanned this on [date] at [location]"
    // Show previous decision and notes
}
```

## Files Changed

### Modified
- `shared/database.py` - Added scan_history table and methods
- `isbn_lot_optimizer/service.py` - Added log_scan() method and auto-logging
- `isbn_web/api/routes/books.py` - Added 4 new endpoints

### Created
- `SCAN_HISTORY_FEATURE.md` - Complete feature documentation
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## Database Migration

No manual migration needed! The `scan_history` table is created automatically via:
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS scan_history (...)
```

Next time any app connects to the database, the table will be created.

## Benefits

### For You (The User)
- Never rescan the same book twice
- Know which stores are worth visiting
- Remember where you saw valuable books
- Track your buying patterns
- Avoid rejected books

### For The Business
- Location-based analytics
- Understand customer behavior
- Optimize store routes
- Data-driven inventory decisions

## Privacy & Security

- All data stored locally in `~/.isbn_lot_optimizer/catalog.db`
- Location tracking requires user permission
- Location data optional (can disable in settings)
- Can use custom location names for privacy ("Store A" vs full address)
- No external servers (except your own backend)

## Performance

- Indexed queries = fast lookups
- Async logging = doesn't slow down scans
- Graceful degradation if logging fails
- Minimal storage overhead (~100 bytes per scan)

## Example: Complete Flow

1. **User opens iOS app at bookstore**
   - App requests location (if authorized)
   - Gets coordinates: 39.7392, -104.9903
   - Reverse geocodes to: "Half Price Books Denver"

2. **User scans a book**
   - App checks scan history: "You saw this 2 weeks ago here, rejected (price too high)"
   - User decides to scan anyway (maybe price dropped)

3. **Book is evaluated**
   - Backend: $12.99 estimated value
   - BookScouter: Best buyback $8.50
   - Recommendation: DON'T BUY (low margin)

4. **User taps "Don't Buy"**
   - App calls: `POST /api/books/log-scan`
   - Logs: REJECT decision with location
   - Notes: "Still too expensive"

5. **Later: User returns to same store**
   - Can query: "Show me all REJECTs from this location"
   - Sees list of books to avoid
   - Focuses on new inventory

## Success Metrics

After iOS integration is complete, you'll be able to answer:

- Which stores have the best acceptance rates?
- How many unique books have I evaluated?
- What's my overall acceptance rate?
- Which locations am I most productive at?
- How many times have I seen the same book?
- What books did I pass on that I might want to revisit?

## Status: Production Ready (Backend)

The backend is complete and tested. It will automatically log all ACCEPT decisions when books are added to the catalog.

To use immediately (before iOS integration):
1. Backend auto-logs ACCEPTs ✓
2. Can manually log REJECTs via Python API
3. Can query history via command line

After iOS integration:
1. Full location tracking
2. Automatic REJECT logging
3. "Previously scanned" warnings
4. Location-based filtering
5. Scan history UI

**Next Task:** Implement iOS location tracking and UI integration
