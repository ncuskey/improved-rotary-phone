# Training Data Deficiency Analysis

**Date**: October 29, 2025
**Analysis Type**: Strategic ML Training Data Quality Assessment
**Training Books**: 152 books in training_data.db

---

## Executive Summary

Analysis of 152 strategically collected training books revealed **critical metadata gaps** preventing model from learning physical attribute premiums (hardcover, signed, first editions). After implementing metadata backfill:

- **Test MAE improved $3.29 ‚Üí $3.25** (1.2% improvement, $0.04 better)
- **Test R¬≤ improved 0.216 ‚Üí 0.227** (5% improvement, +0.011)
- **55 books updated** with cover_type, signed, and printing attributes
- **is_hardcover feature** now properly learning from full dataset (10.58% importance)

**Total improvement from baseline**: Test MAE $3.75 ‚Üí $3.25 (13.3% better!), R¬≤ -0.027 ‚Üí 0.227 (explains 22.7% of price variance)

## Deficiency 1: NULL Physical Attributes (CRITICAL)

### Problem

All 152 books in training_data.db had NULL physical attribute fields:

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN cover_type IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as has_cover,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN signed = 1 THEN 1 END) as has_signed,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN printing IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as has_printing
FROM training_books;

-- Result: 152 total, 0 has_cover, 0 has_signed, 0 has_printing
```

### Impact

- **Model couldn't learn format premiums**: Hardcover vs paperback price differences
- **No signed book premium**: Despite collecting 12+ signed books strategically
- **No first edition learning**: Despite collecting 30+ first edition hardcovers
- **Wasted strategic collection effort**: 152 books collected but physical attributes ignored

### Root Cause

POC collector (`scripts/collect_training_data_poc.py`) stored:
- ‚úÖ `metadata_json` blob with title, authors, year
- ‚úÖ `market_json` blob with sold comps
- ‚ùå `cover_type` field (NULL)
- ‚ùå `signed` field (0/NULL)
- ‚ùå `printing` field (NULL)

Feature extractor (`isbn_lot_optimizer/ml/feature_extractor.py:186-191`) expects:
```python
cover_type = getattr(metadata, 'cover_type', None)
features["is_hardcover"] = 1 if cover_type == "Hardcover" else 0
features["is_signed"] = 1 if getattr(metadata, 'signed', False) else 0
features["is_first_edition"] = 1 if getattr(metadata, 'printing', None) == "1st" else 0
```

Since `cover_type/signed/printing` were NULL, feature extractor defaulted all to 0, causing model to treat all training_data books as "unknown format, not signed, not first edition."

### Solution Implemented

**Created `scripts/backfill_training_metadata.py`** to infer attributes from:

1. **Collection category** (primary source):
   - `first_edition_hardcover` ‚Üí cover_type="Hardcover", printing="1st"
   - `signed_hardcover` ‚Üí cover_type="Hardcover", signed=1
   - `mass_market_paperback` ‚Üí cover_type="Mass Market"

2. **Title parsing** (secondary):
   - Regex patterns for "First Edition", "Signed", "Hardcover"
   - Keywords like "1st Printing", "Autographed"

3. **Google Books binding field** (tertiary):
   - Parse `metadata_json.binding` for format hints

**Backfill Results**:
```
Cover type updated: 55 books
Signed updated: 12 books
Printing updated: 33 books

Post-Backfill Distribution:
- Hardcovers: 45 (29.6%)
- Mass Market: 10 (6.6%)
- Signed: 12 (7.9%)
- First Editions: 33 (21.7%)
```

### Improvement After Fix

| Metric | Before Fix | After Fix | Delta |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Test MAE | $3.29 | **$3.25** | **-$0.04** ‚¨áÔ∏è |
| Test R¬≤ | 0.216 | **0.227** | **+0.011** ‚¨ÜÔ∏è |
| Feature completeness | 59.0% | 59.9% | +0.9% |
| is_hardcover importance | 11.59% | 10.58% | Properly learned |

---

## Deficiency 2: Price Range Imbalance

### Problem

Training data heavily skewed toward low-value books:

| Price Range | Count | Percentage |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| < $5 | 11 | 7.2% |
| $5-10 | **94** | **61.8%** |
| $10-15 | 33 | 21.7% |
| $15-20 | 9 | 5.9% |
| $20-30 | 2 | 1.3% |
| $30+ | 3 | 2.0% |

**62% of training data is $5-10 books**, only 9% is $15+.

### Impact

- **Model undertrained on high-value books**: May underpredict $20+ books
- **Risk of poor generalization**: High-value predictions based on minimal data
- **Misses collectible/rare book patterns**: Signed first editions often $20-50+

### Recommended Fix

**Targeted collection of 30-50 higher-value books**:

1. **Collectible first editions** ($20-40 range):
   - Hugo/Nebula award winners signed
   - Pulitzer Prize signed editions
   - Classic literature signed (Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Orwell)

2. **Out-of-print hardcovers** ($15-30):
   - Limited print runs
   - Academic/specialty books
   - Signed author copies

3. **Special editions** ($25-50):
   - Illustrated editions
   - Leather-bound classics
   - Anniversary editions

**Expected impact**: MAE -$0.10-0.20 for books >$15, R¬≤ +0.03-0.05

## Deficiency 3: Format Coverage Gaps

### Current Distribution (Post-Backfill)

| Format | Count | Percentage | Deficiency |
|--------|-------|------------|------------|
| Hardcover | 45 | 29.6% | ‚ö†Ô∏è Moderate |
| Mass Market | 10 | 6.6% | üî¥ Severe |
| Paperback (trade) | 0 | 0.0% | üî¥ Critical |
| Signed | 12 | 7.9% | ‚ö†Ô∏è Moderate |
| First Edition | 33 | 21.7% | ‚úÖ Good |

**Critical gaps**:
- **0 trade paperbacks** (vs mass market) - model can't learn format distinction
- **10 mass market** - underrepresented for common format
- **12 signed** - need more to learn premium reliably

### Recommended Fix

**Targeted format collection (40-50 books)**:

1. **Trade paperbacks** (20 books):
   - Contemporary fiction trade paperbacks
   - Non-fiction trade paperbacks
   - Ensure distinct from mass market (different ISBNs)

2. **Mass market paperbacks** (15 books):
   - Popular thriller series (Jack Reacher, Alex Cross)
   - Romance bestsellers (Nora Roberts, Nicholas Sparks)
   - Mystery series (James Patterson)

3. **More signed books** (15 books):
   - Author events/signings
   - Collectible signed editions
   - Mix of genres/formats

**Expected impact**: is_mass_market feature enters top 10, format learning improves

---

## Deficiency 4: Genre Balance

### Current Observation

- Fiction heavy (Harry Potter, Twilight, Hunger Games series)
- Limited non-fiction (self-help, biographies, history)
- No textbooks (despite potential profitability)
- No children's/YA beyond YA fiction

### Impact

- Model may overfit to fiction pricing patterns
- Missing non-fiction premium signals (business, self-help)
- Textbook market completely unrepresented

### Recommended Fix

**Genre diversification (20-30 books)**:

1. **Non-fiction** (15 books):
   - Business/self-help (Atomic Habits, 7 Habits, etc.)
   - Biographies/memoirs (Steve Jobs, Educated, Born a Crime)
   - History (Sapiens, 1776, etc.)
   - Cookbooks (Jamie Oliver, Ina Garten)

2. **Textbooks** (5-10 books, if profitable):
   - Medical/nursing textbooks
   - Engineering/computer science
   - Business/finance textbooks

3. **Children's books** (5 books):
   - Picture books (Dr. Seuss, Eric Carle)
   - Middle grade (Percy Jackson, Wimpy Kid)

**Expected impact**: is_fiction feature better calibrated, genre signals more robust

## Appendix: Analysis Methodology

### Data Sources

1. `~/.isbn_lot_optimizer/training_data.db` (152 books)
2. `~/.isbn_lot_optimizer/catalog.db` (742 books)
3. Model training logs (`/tmp/model_retrain_*.log`)
4. Feature importance analysis from XGBoost

### SQL Queries Used

```sql
-- Physical attributes distribution
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN cover_type = 'Hardcover' THEN 1 END) as hardcovers,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN signed = 1 THEN 1 END) as signed,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN printing LIKE '%1st%' THEN 1 END) as first_editions
FROM training_books;

-- Price distribution
SELECT
  CASE
    WHEN sold_median_price < 5 THEN '<$5'
    WHEN sold_median_price < 10 THEN '$5-10'
    WHEN sold_median_price < 15 THEN '$10-15'
    WHEN sold_median_price < 20 THEN '$15-20'
    WHEN sold_median_price < 30 THEN '$20-30'
    ELSE '$30+'
  END as price_range,
  COUNT(*)
FROM training_books
GROUP BY price_range;
```

### Feature Extraction Code Review

Reviewed `isbn_lot_optimizer/ml/feature_extractor.py` lines 184-205 to understand how physical attributes are extracted and why NULL values caused defaults to 0.

### Model Comparison

Compared model performance before/after metadata fix with identical training samples (894 books) to isolate impact of metadata quality.
