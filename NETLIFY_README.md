# Why This App Won't Work on Netlify

## The Problem

You have a **Python FastAPI backend application** that requires a continuously running server. Netlify is designed for **static websites** and **serverless functions**, which is fundamentally different from what your app needs.

## Technical Differences

### What Netlify Supports:
- ‚úÖ Static HTML/CSS/JavaScript files
- ‚úÖ Serverless functions (short-lived, triggered by requests)
- ‚úÖ Pre-built static site generators (Gatsby, Next.js, Hugo)

### What Your ISBN Lot Optimizer Needs:
- ‚ùå Long-running Python FastAPI server (not serverless)
- ‚ùå Server-side template rendering (Jinja2)
- ‚ùå Database connections (SQLite or PostgreSQL)
- ‚ùå WebSocket/SSE for real-time updates
- ‚ùå Stateful sessions

**Bottom line:** Your app needs a platform that runs Python web servers 24/7.

## What To Do

### Option 1: Disconnect Netlify (Recommended)

1. Go to your Netlify dashboard
2. Find the ISBN Lot Optimizer site
3. Click "Site settings"
4. Scroll down and click "Delete site"

Then follow **QUICK_DEPLOY.md** to deploy to Railway instead.

### Option 2: Keep Netlify Connected (It Won't Deploy)

The `netlify.toml` file I created will:
- Prevent Netlify from building your app
- Show an error message explaining why it won't work
- Not affect your code or other deployment options

You can safely ignore Netlify's failed build notifications.

## Proper Deployment Path

### Use Railway (Takes 5 Minutes):

1. **Go to Railway:**
   - Visit https://railway.app
   - Sign in with GitHub

2. **Deploy:**
   - Click "New Project" ‚Üí "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Select your repository
   - Railway automatically detects `railway.json`
   - Your app deploys in 2-3 minutes

3. **Get URL:**
   - Click "Generate Domain"
   - Visit `your-app.railway.app`
   - Done! ‚úÖ

### Alternative: Render or Fly.io

Both work great for Python apps. See **DEPLOYMENT.md** for full guides.

## GitHub ‚Üí Multiple Platforms

Good news: You can deploy the same GitHub repo to multiple platforms!

- **GitHub:** Your code repository
- **Railway/Render/Fly.io:** Where your app actually runs
- **Netlify:** Disconnect it (or ignore failed builds)

## Why Railway/Render Over Netlify?

| Feature | Netlify | Railway/Render |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| Static Sites | ‚úÖ Excellent | ‚ùå Not their focus |
| Python Servers | ‚ùå Not supported | ‚úÖ Perfect for this |
| Database | ‚ùå No built-in | ‚úÖ PostgreSQL included |
| Cost | Free for static | Free tier available |
| Use Case | Blogs, docs | Web apps, APIs |

## Summary

**Your app = Python FastAPI server = Needs Railway/Render/Fly.io**

Not Netlify's fault - it's just the wrong tool for this job. Like trying to cut wood with a hammer instead of a saw.

Follow **QUICK_DEPLOY.md** to get your app live on Railway in 5 minutes! üöÄ
