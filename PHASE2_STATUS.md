## How to Continue

### Option 1: Manual Consolidation
Follow this document and create remaining files in `docs/` subdirectories.

### Option 2: Automated Script
Create a script to:
1. Move files to appropriate locations
2. Update internal links
3. Update README.md
4. Delete old files

### Option 3: Incremental
Complete one category at a time:
1. Deployment docs
2. App docs
3. Feature docs
4. Development docs
5. Update README
6. Clean up old files

## Next Steps

**Recommended:** Continue with deployment documentation consolidation.

**Command:**
```bash
# Create deployment docs
# Then consolidate DEPLOYMENT.md + QUICK_DEPLOY.md
```

**Or:** Commit Phase 1 + partial Phase 2 work now, continue later.
