# eBay Market Data Investigation Report

**Date**: October 28, 2025
**Status**: ⚠️ Critical Issue Identified
**Priority**: HIGH - Blocking ML Model Improvement

---

## Executive Summary

Investigation reveals that **99.3% of books lack eBay market data** (active_count, sold_count, sell_through_rate) due to deprecated Finding API. This blocks 15% of ML features and prevents model improvement from Test MAE $3.75 to target $2.50.

**Quick Fix Available**: Run `refresh_ebay_pricing.py` to populate active listing data for all 758 books (~19 minutes).

**Constraint**: Marketplace Insights API (Track A) is not available. Track B (active listings + estimates) is our only option, which provides 2 of 4 eBay features (active_count, active_median_price).

---

## Problem Statement

The ML price estimation model expects comprehensive eBay market data in `market_json` field:

```python
# Expected EbayMarketStats fields:
- active_count          # Number of active eBay listings
- active_median_price   # Median price of active listings
- sold_count            # Number of sold items (90-day history)
- sold_avg_price        # Average sold price
- sell_through_rate     # sold / (sold + active) ratio
```

**Current State**:
- Total books: **758**
- Books with sold_comps: **549 (72.4%)** ✓
- Books with active_count: **3 (0.4%)** ✗
- Books with sold_count > 0: **0 (0%)** ✗

**Impact on ML Model**:
```python
# From feature_extractor.py lines 130-145:
features["ebay_sold_count"] = 0       # Always 0 → model can't learn
features["ebay_active_count"] = 0     # Missing for 99.6%
features["ebay_active_median"] = 0    # Missing for 99.6%
features["sell_through_rate"] = 0     # Always 0 → model can't learn
```

These 4 features account for **~15% of potential model signal** but are currently unused.

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Deprecated eBay Finding API

From `refresh_all_market_data.py` lines 10-15:

```python
"""
NOTE: eBay market data requires the eBay Browse API which is only available
through the token broker service (used by the iOS app). The old Finding API
that this script uses is deprecated and no longer returns data.
"""
```

**Historical Context**:
- `query_ebay_market_snapshot()` in `shared/market.py` uses Finding API
- Finding API operations: `findItemsByProduct` (active) + `findCompletedItems` (sold)
- Finding API deprecated in **2021**, sold history no longer available
- Browse API (replacement) only provides **active listings**, not sold history

### 2. Data Collection Scripts Mismatch

Three scripts exist but serve different purposes:

| Script | Purpose | What It Populates | Status |
|--------|---------|-------------------|--------|
| `collect_training_data.py` | Fetch Track B sold comps | sold_comps_* fields only | ✓ Working (549/758) |
| `refresh_ebay_pricing.py` | Fetch active listing data | active_count, active_median | ❌ Not run |
| `refresh_all_market_data.py` | Full refresh via BookService | All market data | ⚠️ Deprecated API |

**The Issue**:
- `collect_training_data.py` was run for ML training → populated sold_comps
- But sold_comps are **Track B estimates**, not the real EbayMarketStats the model expects
- Active listing data was never collected → missing active_count, active_median_price

### 3. Sample Data from 3 Valid Books

```json
{
  "isbn": "9780545349277",
  "active_count": 15,              // ✓ Has active data
  "active_avg_price": 11.08,
  "active_median_price": 13.99,
  "sold_count": 0,                 // ✗ Finding API deprecated
  "sold_avg_price": null,
  "sell_through_rate": null,       // ✗ Can't calculate without sold
  "currency": "USD"
}
```

Even the 3 "valid" books have `sold_count: 0` because Finding API is deprecated.

---

## Available Solutions

### Option 1: Populate Active Listing Data (RECOMMENDED - Immediate)

**Run the existing refresh script:**

```bash
# Populate active listing data for all 758 books
python3 scripts/refresh_ebay_pricing.py

# Estimated time: 758 books × 1.5s delay = 19 minutes
```

**What This Provides**:
- `active_count` - Number of current listings
- `active_median_price` - Current market price
- `sold_comps_*` - Track B estimates (25th percentile)

**What's Still Missing**:
- Real sold history (sold_count, sold_avg_price)
- Sell-through rate calculation

**ML Model Impact**:
- Enables `active_count` feature (currently 0% populated)
- Enables `active_median` feature (currently 0% populated)
- Still missing 2/4 eBay features (sold_count, sell_through_rate)
- Estimated improvement: **+5-8% feature signal**

### Option 2: Marketplace Insights API (Track A - Best Quality)

**Status**: ❌ NOT AVAILABLE - No access to Marketplace Insights API

**From `shared/ebay_sold_comps.py` lines 119-135:**

```python
def _get_mi_sold_comps(self, gtin: str, ...):
    """
    Track A: Get real sold data from Marketplace Insights API.
    Returns None if MI not available (501 error).
    """
    resp = requests.get(url, params=params, timeout=self.timeout)

    # 501 = MI not enabled yet
    if resp.status_code == 501:
        return None
```

**What This Would Provide** (if we had it):
- Real sold transaction data (not estimates)
- Actual sold prices and dates
- Historical velocity metrics
- Better data quality than Track B

**Reality**: This is NOT an option for us. Track B is our only path forward.

### Option 3: iOS App Token Broker (Best Integration)

**From `refresh_all_market_data.py` documentation:**

```python
"""
For full eBay + Amazon data, use the iOS app's "Refresh All Books" feature
or the backend API's token broker integration.
"""
```

**What This Provides**:
- Browse API access (active listings)
- Sold comps via Track B
- Potentially Track A if MI is enabled
- Integrated with iOS workflow

**Implementation**: Already exists, just needs to be used consistently

---

## Comparison: Track A vs Track B

| Aspect | Track A (MI API) | Track B (Active Estimate) | Current State |
|--------|------------------|---------------------------|---------------|
| **Data Source** | Real sold transactions | Active listings | ❌ Neither |
| **Accuracy** | High (actual sales) | Medium (conservative) | N/A |
| **Availability** | Requires approval | ✓ Available now | ❌ Not collected |
| **Features** | sold_count, sold_avg, sell_through | active_count, active_median | None |
| **Cost** | Unknown (API fees?) | Standard Browse API | $0 |
| **Implementation** | Already coded (501 check) | Already coded | ✓ Ready |

**Current Reality**: System is designed for Track A, falls back to Track B, but neither is being used for ML training.

```
Top 10 Features (28 total):
1. is_good            35.86%  ← Condition dominates
2. is_very_good       11.51%
3. is_hardcover        9.02%  ← Book attributes working!
4. amazon_count        7.48%  ← Amazon data working
5. is_fiction          6.59%
6. log_amazon_rank     5.24%
7. log_ratings         4.63%
8. age_years           4.36%
9. rating              4.31%
10. is_paperback       4.17%

Missing eBay Features (all 0% importance):
- ebay_sold_count      0.00%  ← Deprecated API
- ebay_active_count    0.00%  ← Not collected
- ebay_active_median   0.00%  ← Not collected
- sell_through_rate    0.00%  ← Can't calculate
```

### Projected Improvement with eBay Data

Based on feature engineering best practices and domain knowledge:

**Conservative Estimate**:
- eBay active features: +5-8% combined importance
- Test MAE: $3.75 → $3.50 (7% improvement)
- Test R²: -0.027 → +0.05 (better generalization)

**Optimistic Estimate** (NOT AVAILABLE - requires MI):
- ~~eBay sold features: +10-15% combined importance~~
- ~~Active + sold synergy: Better than sum of parts~~
- ~~Test MAE: $3.75 → $3.00 (20% improvement)~~
- ~~Test R²: -0.027 → +0.15 (strong generalization)~~

**Reality Check**: With Track B only, conservative estimate is realistic target. Sold features (sold_count, sell_through_rate) will remain 0.

## Recommended Action Plan

### Phase 1: Immediate Fix (Week 1) ⚡

**Goal**: Populate active listing data for existing 758 books

```bash
# Step 1: Verify environment variables
cat .env | grep EBAY_CLIENT_ID  # Must be set for Browse API

# Step 2: Run pricing refresh (19 minutes)
python3 scripts/refresh_ebay_pricing.py

# Step 3: Verify population
sqlite3 ~/.isbn_lot_optimizer/catalog.db \
  "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM books WHERE json_extract(market_json, '$.active_count') > 0"
# Expected: ~700+ (some books may not have eBay listings)

# Step 4: Retrain model with new features
python3 scripts/train_price_model.py

# Step 5: Compare performance
# Before: Test MAE $3.75
# After:  Test MAE $3.50-$3.60 (target)
```

**Success Criteria**:
- ✓ 90%+ books have active_count > 0
- ✓ ebay_active_count feature importance > 0%
- ✓ ebay_active_median feature importance > 0%
- ✓ Test MAE improved by 5-10%

**Time**: 30-45 minutes (mostly waiting for API calls)

### Phase 2: iOS Integration (Week 2-3)

**Goal**: Consistent data collection through iOS app

1. Document "Refresh All Books" workflow in app
2. Add UI to show last market data refresh timestamp
3. Recommend refresh every 7-14 days for active sellers
4. Track data quality metrics (% books with market_json)

**Benefit**: Users keep their own data fresh without manual scripts

### ~~Phase 3: Marketplace Insights Enablement~~ (NOT AVAILABLE)

**Status**: ❌ No access to Marketplace Insights API

~~**Goal**: Access Track A real sold data~~

This option is off the table. We will continue with Track B (active listings + estimates) as our only eBay data source. The model will have 2 of 4 eBay features populated, which is still a meaningful improvement over the current 0 of 4.

## Technical Details

### Database Schema

```sql
-- books table market_json field structure:
market_json TEXT  -- JSON with EbayMarketStats structure

-- Currently populated (72% of books):
{
  "sold_comps_count": 15,        -- Track B estimate count
  "sold_comps_min": 8.50,
  "sold_comps_median": 12.99,    -- Used as estimated_price
  "sold_comps_max": 19.99,
  "sold_comps_is_estimate": true,
  "sold_comps_source": "estimate"
}

-- Missing for 99% of books:
{
  "active_count": 15,            -- Number of eBay listings
  "active_median_price": 13.99,  -- Current market price
  "sold_count": 0,               -- Deprecated Finding API
  "sell_through_rate": null      -- Can't calculate
}
```

### API Dependencies

```python
# shared/market.py - Three API access methods:

1. Finding API (DEPRECATED):
   - findItemsByProduct (active)
   - findCompletedItems (sold) ← NO LONGER WORKS

2. Browse API (WORKING):
   - /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search
   - Returns: active listings only
   - Requires: OAuth app token

3. Token Broker (iOS + Backend):
   - Proxies Browse API calls
   - Handles authentication
   - Endpoint: http://localhost:8787/sold/ebay
```

### Feature Extractor Logic

From `isbn_lot_optimizer/ml/feature_extractor.py` lines 130-145:

```python
if market:
    features["ebay_sold_count"] = market.sold_count if market.sold_count is not None else 0
    features["ebay_active_count"] = market.active_count if market.active_count else 0
    features["ebay_active_median"] = market.active_median_price if market.active_median_price else 0
    features["sell_through_rate"] = market.sell_through_rate if market.sell_through_rate else 0

    if market.sold_count is None or market.sold_count == 0:
        missing.append("ebay_sold_count")  # Currently ALWAYS missing
    if not market.active_median_price:
        missing.append("ebay_active_median")  # Currently missing for 99%
else:
    # All 4 features default to 0
    features["ebay_sold_count"] = 0
    features["ebay_active_count"] = 0
    features["ebay_active_median"] = 0
    features["sell_through_rate"] = 0
```

**Problem**: When market_json is incomplete, features default to 0 and model treats as "no signal" rather than learning meaningful patterns.

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Option 1: Run refresh_ebay_pricing.py

**Costs**:
- Time: 19 minutes of API calls (one-time)
- eBay API calls: 758 Browse API requests (within free tier)
- Developer time: 15 minutes setup + monitoring

**Benefits**:
- Enables 2/4 eBay features immediately
- +5-8% feature signal → likely -$0.15-$0.25 MAE improvement
- Improves user price estimates TODAY
- Low risk (read-only API calls)

**ROI**: 15 minutes work → measurable ML improvement

### Option 2: Marketplace Insights API (Future)

**Costs**:
- Time: Weeks-months for approval process
- Potential API fees (unknown, needs research)
- Integration time: Already coded, just needs enablement

**Benefits**:
- Real sold data (not estimates)
- +10-15% feature signal → -$0.50-$0.75 MAE improvement
- Enables sell_through_rate (strong predictor)
- Competitive advantage (ScoutIQ doesn't have this)

**ROI**: High, but long timeline

---

## Conclusion

**Immediate Action Required**: Run `refresh_ebay_pricing.py` to populate active listing data for 758 books (19 minutes). This unblocks 2 of 4 eBay features and provides immediate ML model improvement path.

**Medium-term**: Pursue Marketplace Insights API access for real sold transaction data.

**Long-term**: Integrate data refresh into iOS app workflow to keep market data fresh as users scan books.

**Current State**: ML model is performing at $3.75 MAE with only Amazon + metadata features. Adding eBay market data could improve to $3.00-$3.50 range based on feature engineering theory.

**Next Step**: Execute Phase 1 action plan (30-45 minutes total time).
