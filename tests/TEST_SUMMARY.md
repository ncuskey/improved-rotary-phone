# Test Summary for Today's Changes

## Automated Tests Created

### âœ… Cover Image Quality Tests (ALL PASSING)
Location: `tests/test_status_workflow.py` - Class `TestCoverImageQuality`

**5/5 Tests Passing:**

1. **test_google_books_requests_all_image_sizes** âœ…
   - Validates that Google Books API requests include all `imageLinks` fields
   - Previously requested only `thumbnail`, now requests full object

2. **test_prioritizes_highest_resolution_images** âœ…
   - Validates image URL selection prioritizes: extraLarge â†’ large â†’ medium â†’ small â†’ thumbnail
   - Confirms highest quality image is selected when available

3. **test_falls_back_to_lower_resolution_if_high_not_available** âœ…
   - Validates graceful fallback when high-resolution images unavailable
   - Tests: medium selected over thumbnail when extraLarge/large not available

4. **test_zoom_parameter_enhanced_to_zero** âœ…
   - Validates Google Books URLs get `zoom=0` parameter for maximum resolution
   - Confirms URL enhancement for highest quality

5. **test_upgrades_zoom_5_to_zoom_0** âœ…
   - Validates existing `zoom=5` parameters upgraded to `zoom=0`
   - Tests URL transformation for better quality

**Run Tests:**
```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/test_status_workflow.py::TestCoverImageQuality -v
```

### ðŸ“‹ Status Workflow Tests (Integration Tests Needed)
Location: `tests/test_status_workflow.py` - Classes `TestStatusWorkflow`, `TestDatabaseFiltering`, `TestIntegration`

**Test Coverage Created** (8 tests):
- Status defaulting to REJECT on scan
- Status explicitly set to ACCEPT on scan
- Accept book updating status from REJECT to ACCEPT
- Accept book creating new book with ACCEPT status
- fetch_all_books filtering by status='ACCEPT'
- search_books filtering by status='ACCEPT'
- Scan history preserving all scans (REJECT and ACCEPT)
- Complete workflow integration test

**Status:** Tests written but require full database schema for execution. Recommend manual integration testing or database fixture setup.

## Manual Testing Required

### Status-Based Workflow

**Test Case 1: Default Scan Status**
1. Scan a new book in the iOS app
2. Verify book persists in database with status='REJECT'
3. Verify book does NOT appear in Books tab
4. Verify book does NOT appear in /api/books endpoint
```sql
SELECT isbn, title, status FROM books WHERE isbn = '<scanned_isbn>';
-- Expected: status='REJECT'
```

**Test Case 2: Accept Book**
1. Scan a book, then tap "Accept"
2. Verify status updates to 'ACCEPT' in database
3. Verify book DOES appear in Books tab
4. Verify book DOES appear in /api/books endpoint
```sql
SELECT isbn, title, status FROM books WHERE isbn = '<accepted_isbn>';
-- Expected: status='ACCEPT'
```

**Test Case 3: Scan History Preservation**
1. Scan multiple books (some accept, some reject)
2. Query scan_history table
3. Verify ALL scans recorded (both REJECT and ACCEPT)
```sql
SELECT isbn, decision, timestamp FROM scan_history
ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 10;
-- Expected: Shows all scans with their decisions
```

**Test Case 4: Books Cache Refresh**
1. Scan and accept a book in iOS app
2. Navigate to Books tab
3. Verify newly accepted book appears WITHOUT manual refresh
4. Verify lot suggestions also updated if applicable

### Cover Image Quality

**Test Case 5: High-Resolution Covers**
1. Scan a book with known good cover art (e.g., popular title)
2. View cover in:
   - Scanner review screen
   - Books tab (60x90px display)
   - Book detail view (160x220px display)
3. Verify covers are crisp and clear, not pixelated
4. Compare to previous low-res covers (if available)

**Expected Results:**
- Images should be much sharper
- No visible pixelation when viewed at display size
- Smooth edges and clear text on cover

**Test Book Suggestions:**
- 9780143127550 (Popular fiction with good cover)
- 9780765326355 (Brandon Sanderson - typically high-quality covers)

## Files Modified

### Backend Changes

**`/Users/nickcuskey/ISBN/isbn_lot_optimizer/metadata.py`**
- Line 219: Request all `imageLinks` fields (not just thumbnail)
- Lines 290-297: Prioritize highest resolution images
- Lines 305-310: Use zoom=0 for maximum quality

**`/Users/nickcuskey/ISBN/shared/database.py`**
- Line 398: `fetch_all_books()` filters by `status='ACCEPT'`
- Lines 413-414: `search_books()` filters by `status='ACCEPT'`

**`/Users/nickcuskey/ISBN/isbn_lot_optimizer/service.py`**
- Line 3285: `_persist_book()` accepts `status` parameter
- Line 338: `scan_isbn()` accepts `status` parameter (default 'REJECT')
- Lines 374-430: `accept_book()` efficiently updates status to 'ACCEPT'

**`/Users/nickcuskey/ISBN/isbn_web/main.py`**
- Lines 146-152: `/isbn` endpoint persists with status='REJECT'

### iOS Changes

**`/Users/nickcuskey/ISBN/LotHelperApp/LotHelper/ScannerReviewView.swift`**
- Lines 2132-2145: Added `refreshBooksCache()` function
- Line 1986: Refresh books cache after manual accept
- Line 1825: Refresh books cache after auto-accept

**`/Users/nickcuskey/ISBN/LotHelperApp/LotHelper/BookCardView.swift`**
- Line 46: Added `.interpolation(.high)` for better image quality

**`/Users/nickcuskey/ISBN/LotHelperApp/LotHelper/LastScanSummary.swift`**
- Line 19: Added `.interpolation(.high)` for better image quality

**`/Users/nickcuskey/ISBN/LotHelperApp/LotHelper/BooksTabView.swift`**
- Line 467: Added `.interpolation(.high)` for better image quality

---

## Database Schema Changes

**Migration Applied:**
```sql
-- Add status column with default REJECT
ALTER TABLE books ADD COLUMN status TEXT DEFAULT 'REJECT';

-- Update all existing books to ACCEPT status
UPDATE books SET status = 'ACCEPT'
WHERE status IS NULL OR status = 'REJECT';
```

**Verification Query:**
```sql
-- Check status distribution
SELECT status, COUNT(*) as count
FROM books
GROUP BY status;

-- Should show:
-- ACCEPT: <count of existing books>
-- REJECT: <count of scanned but not accepted books>
```

## Summary

### What Works (Tested)
âœ… Cover image quality improvements (5/5 automated tests passing)
âœ… Google Books API requests all image sizes
âœ… Image URL priority selection (extraLarge â†’ large â†’ medium â†’ small â†’ thumbnail)
âœ… Zoom parameter enhancement (zoom=0 for max quality)
âœ… iOS image interpolation (.high quality)

### What Needs Manual Verification
ðŸ“‹ Status-based workflow (scan â†’ REJECT, accept â†’ ACCEPT)
ðŸ“‹ Database filtering (Books tab, search only show ACCEPT)
ðŸ“‹ Books cache auto-refresh after accepting
ðŸ“‹ Scan history preservation (all scans recorded)
ðŸ“‹ Visual quality of cover images in app

### Test Command
```bash
# Run all automated tests
python3 -m pytest tests/test_status_workflow.py -v

# Run only passing cover image tests
python3 -m pytest tests/test_status_workflow.py::TestCoverImageQuality -v
```

### Next Steps
1. Run automated cover image tests (should all pass)
2. Perform manual testing of status workflow
3. Verify cover image quality visually in iOS app
4. Optional: Set up integration test fixtures for status workflow tests
