# Cover Checker - Usage Instructions

## ✅ Script is Now Working!

The cover checker script has been fixed and will now:
- Auto-detect your database (`catalog.db` at `~/.isbn_lot_optimizer/`)
- Check all 702 books in your catalog
- Show progress every 10 books

## ⏱️ Expected Runtime

**Check-only mode:** 5-10 minutes for 702 books
- Sends HEAD request to each cover URL
- Shows progress every 10 books

**Fix mode:** 10-20 minutes for fixing missing covers
- Downloads actual covers from Open Library
- Rate limited to 2 requests/second
- Updates database with new URLs

## 📊 Running the Script

### 1. Check Only (What You're Running Now)
```bash
python scripts/check_missing_covers.py --check-only
```

**What it does:**
- Scans all 702 books
- Checks if they have cover URLs
- Validates URLs are accessible
- **Does not** download or fix anything

**Output:**
```
Checking 702 books for cover images...
------------------------------------------------------------
Progress: 10/702 (8 valid, 2 missing, 0 broken)
Progress: 20/702 (17 valid, 3 missing, 0 broken)
...
Progress: 700/702 (650 valid, 45 missing, 7 broken)

============================================================
SUMMARY
============================================================
Total books:      702
Checked:          702
Valid covers:     650 (92.6%)
Missing covers:   45 (6.4%)
Broken covers:    7 (1.0%)
```

### 2. Fix Missing Covers
```bash
python scripts/check_missing_covers.py --fix
```

**What it does:**
- Identifies books without covers
- Downloads from Open Library
- Updates database with working URLs
- Shows success/failure for each fix

**Output:**
```
...
  ✅ Fixed: Ship of Magic -> https://covers.openlibrary.org/...
  ✅ Fixed: Dune -> https://covers.openlibrary.org/...
  ❌ No cover found: Unknown Book Title

============================================================
SUMMARY
============================================================
Total books:      702
...
Fixed:            38
Failed to fix:    7
```

### 3. Use Different Database
```bash
python scripts/check_missing_covers.py --db /path/to/other.db --check-only
```

## 🎯 What Happens Next

After the script completes:

1. **Check-only:** You'll see statistics about cover coverage
2. **Fix mode:** Database will be updated with new cover URLs
3. **iOS App:** Will automatically show new covers on next sync
4. **Web App:** Will display covers from updated URLs

## 💡 Tips

### Speed Up Checking
The script validates each URL with a HEAD request. For 702 books, this takes time. You can:
- Let it run in background
- Use tmux/screen to detach
- Schedule as overnight job

### Reduce Scope
Check specific books only:
```bash
# Add this feature if needed - currently checks all books
```

### Monitor Progress
Watch the output:
```bash
python scripts/check_missing_covers.py --check-only 2>&1 | tee cover_check.log
```

## 📈 Typical Coverage

Based on your 702 books, expect:
- **90-95% have covers** (630-667 books) - Most from Google Books/Open Library
- **5-10% missing** (35-70 books) - Obscure titles, old editions
- **<2% broken** (<14 books) - URLs changed or expired

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Script hangs at "Checking 702 books..."
**Normal!** It's checking each URL. Progress updates every 10 books.

### "Database not found"
**Fixed!** Script now auto-detects `catalog.db`.

### httpx errors or timeouts
**Normal!** Some URLs are slow or dead. Script continues past errors.

### No covers get fixed
Check if Open Library has covers for your ISBNs:
```bash
# Test manually
curl -I https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/isbn/9780670855032-L.jpg
```

## ⏭️ After Script Completes

**Check-only:**
1. Review the summary statistics
2. Decide if you want to run `--fix`
3. Check which books are missing covers

**Fix mode:**
1. Restart your backend server (if running)
2. iOS app will fetch new covers on next sync
3. Web app will display new covers immediately

## 🎉 Expected Results

For your 702 books, the script should:
- ✅ Identify ~630-670 books with valid covers
- 🔍 Find ~30-70 books missing covers
- 🔧 Fix ~25-50 of the missing (if you run --fix)
- ❌ Leave ~5-20 unfixable (truly no covers available)

**Your catalog will look much more professional!** 📚✨
