# Cache Busting Configuration

## Problem
Browsers cache static files (JavaScript, CSS) aggressively, causing users to see outdated versions of the app even after updates are deployed. Users were required to hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R) to see new features.

## Solution
Implemented **no-cache headers** on all static files to force browsers to always fetch the latest version.

## Changes Made

### `isbn_web/main.py`

#### 1. Added NoCacheStaticFiles Class
```python
class NoCacheStaticFiles(StaticFiles):
    """StaticFiles subclass that adds no-cache headers to all responses."""

    async def get_response(self, path: str, scope):
        response = await super().get_response(path, scope)
        # Force no caching for all static files
        response.headers["Cache-Control"] = "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate"
        response.headers["Pragma"] = "no-cache"
        response.headers["Expires"] = "0"
        return response
```

#### 2. Updated Static Files Mount
```python
# Before:
app.mount("/static", StaticFiles(directory=str(settings.STATIC_DIR)), name="static")

# After:
app.mount("/static", NoCacheStaticFiles(directory=str(settings.STATIC_DIR)), name="static")
```

## How It Works

### HTTP Headers Added
Every static file request now includes these headers:

```http
Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate
Pragma: no-cache
Expires: 0
```

**What these mean:**
- `no-cache`: Browser must revalidate with server before using cached copy
- `no-store`: Don't store in cache at all
- `must-revalidate`: Must check with server even if cached
- `Pragma: no-cache`: HTTP/1.0 backward compatibility
- `Expires: 0`: Cache expired immediately

### Cover Images
Note: Cover images (`/covers/*`) still use regular caching since they rarely change and caching them improves performance.

## Verification

### Method 1: Check Headers with curl
```bash
curl -I http://localhost:8000/static/js/app.js
```

Expected output:
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
cache-control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate
pragma: no-cache
expires: 0
...
```

### Method 2: Browser Developer Tools
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Refresh page (F5)
4. Click on any `.js` or `.css` file
5. Check Response Headers - should show:
   ```
   cache-control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate
   pragma: no-cache
   expires: 0
   ```

### Method 3: Test User Experience
1. Deploy new feature
2. Have user simply refresh (F5) - no hard refresh needed!
3. User sees updated features immediately

## Benefits

✅ **No Hard Refresh Required** - Regular F5 refresh always fetches latest version
✅ **Instant Updates** - New features visible immediately after deployment
✅ **Better UX** - Users don't need technical knowledge to see updates
✅ **Simpler Support** - No more "try Ctrl+F5" instructions

## Trade-offs

⚠️ **Slightly More Bandwidth** - Static files fetched on every page load
⚠️ **Minimal Performance Impact** - Files still transfer quickly over HTTP/2

For production apps with high traffic, consider using **versioned URLs** instead:
- `app.js?v=1.2.3` or `app.v1.2.3.js`
- Allows aggressive caching while ensuring updates
- More complex but more efficient at scale

## Alternative: Versioned URLs (Future Enhancement)

If performance becomes an issue, consider:

```python
# In templates, add version query param
<script src="/static/js/app.js?v={{ app_version }}"></script>
```

This allows:
- Long cache times (1 year)
- Instant updates (version changes URL)
- Better performance (fewer requests)

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Start development server: `uvicorn isbn_web.main:app --reload`
- [ ] Open browser DevTools Network tab
- [ ] Load http://localhost:8000
- [ ] Check static file headers include `cache-control: no-cache`
- [ ] Make a code change
- [ ] Refresh browser with F5 (not Ctrl+F5)
- [ ] Verify changes are visible without hard refresh

## Deployment

Changes are automatically active once `isbn_web/main.py` is deployed. No configuration changes needed.
