**eBay Token Broker**: A lightweight Node.js service (`token-broker/`) provides OAuth tokens to the iOS app, keeping your eBay Production credentials secure on the server. Auto-starts with `isbn` or `isbn-web` commands.

## Quick Start
1. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. (Optional) create a `.env` in the repository root or export variables in your shell.
   The app auto-loads `.env` via python-dotenv on startup.
   ```bash
   # eBay APIs
   export EBAY_APP_ID=your-finding-app-id              # Finding API (sold/unsold)
   export EBAY_CLIENT_ID=your-browse-client-id         # Browse API (active comps) + Token Broker
   export EBAY_CLIENT_SECRET=your-browse-client-secret # Token Broker
   export EBAY_MARKETPLACE=EBAY_US                     # Optional (default: EBAY_US)

   # BooksRun (for SELL quotes)
   export BOOKSRUN_KEY=your-booksrun-api-key

   # BookScouter (for multi-vendor quotes and Amazon rank)
   export BOOKSCOUTER_API_KEY=your-bookscouter-api-key

   # Amazon Product Advertising API (for real-time Amazon pricing - OPTIONAL)
   export AMAZON_ACCESS_KEY=your-amazon-access-key      # PA-API 5.0 credentials
   export AMAZON_SECRET_KEY=your-amazon-secret-key      # See docs/AMAZON_API_SETUP.md
   export AMAZON_PARTNER_TAG=yourname-20                 # Your Amazon Associate tag

   # Hardcover API (for series metadata)
   export HARDCOVER_API_TOKEN=your-hardcover-jwt-token  # Get from hardcover.app settings

   # Optional proxy settings
   export HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy:8080
   export HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy:8080
   ```

   **Token Broker**: The eBay token broker (`token-broker/`) auto-starts when you run `isbn` or `isbn-web`. It provides OAuth tokens to the iOS app on port 8787. No additional setup required‚Äîjust set `EBAY_CLIENT_ID` and `EBAY_CLIENT_SECRET` in `.env`.

3. Launch the application:
   
   **Desktop GUI:**
   ```bash
   python -m isbn_lot_optimizer
   ```
   - Scan or type an ISBN, choose a condition, and press Enter. The app persists
     the book, runs metadata + market lookups, refreshes lot recommendations,
     and updates the status bar as background jobs complete.
   - If `EBAY_CLIENT_ID/EBAY_CLIENT_SECRET` are missing, Browse API features are disabled (a warning is printed).
   - Finding API sold/unsold stats are used when `EBAY_APP_ID` is present.
   
   **Web Interface:**
   ```bash
   uvicorn isbn_web.main:app --reload
   ```
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` for the web dashboard
   - Features a modern, responsive interface with:
     - Book scanning and catalog management
     - Interactive lot generation and optimization
     - **3D Book Carousel**: Beautiful lot details page with real book covers
     - HTMX-powered dynamic updates without page refreshes
     - Alpine.js for interactive components

   **Mobile / API integrations:**
   - `POST /isbn` ‚Äì Scan-or-return core metadata for a single ISBN; the backend will
     persist a fresh scan when the book is missing.
   - `GET /api/books/all` ‚Äì JSON payload of every stored book (matches GUI list order).
   - `GET /api/lots/list.json` ‚Äì JSON payload of the saved lot suggestions, including
     embedded book metadata when available.
   - `POST /api/books/search-metadata` ‚Äì Search for books by title/author when ISBN is unknown.
     Returns Google Books results with eBay and Google reference links for manual research.
     Perfect for books with damaged or missing barcodes.
   - `POST /api/books/log-scan` ‚Äì Log scan decisions (ACCEPT/REJECT) with location data.
     Tracks GPS coordinates, place names, device ID, and notes for complete audit trail.
   - `GET /api/books/scan-history` ‚Äì Query scan history with filters (limit, ISBN, location, decision).
   - `GET /api/books/scan-locations` ‚Äì Summary of all scan locations with acceptance rates.
   - `GET /api/books/scan-stats` ‚Äì Overall statistics (total scans, acceptance rates, unique locations).
   - These endpoints power the LotHelper iOS prototype; restart `isbn-web` after
     deploying changes so the routes are reloaded.
   - **iOS UI tip:** ship a minimal `LaunchScreen.storyboard` (white `systemBackground`
     fill) and keep `UIWindow.appearance().backgroundColor = .systemBackground` so the
     app renders flush with the device safe areas instead of letterboxing on hardware.

## 3D Book Carousel

### Troubleshooting

#### "Lot not found" Error
If you see "Lot not found" when clicking on lots:
- Ensure the lots table template uses `{{ lot.id }}` instead of `{{ loop.index0 }}`
- Check that the route `/api/lots/{lot_id}` is working correctly
- Verify JSON feeds for mobile clients:
  - `curl http://localhost:8000/api/books/all`
  - `curl http://localhost:8000/api/lots/list.json`

#### Carousel Not Loading
If the 3D carousel doesn't appear:
- Verify Alpine.js is loaded: Check browser console for `window.Alpine`
- Ensure the `carouselData()` function exists in `base.html`
- Check that `window.lotBooksData` is populated in the page source
- Restart the server to pick up template changes

#### Mobile Issues
If the carousel has issues on mobile devices:
- **Cards positioned incorrectly**: Check if mobile transforms are being applied (console logs)
- **Swipe not working**: Verify touch events are bound and check console for touch logs
- **Performance issues**: Mobile uses reduced 3D complexity for better performance
- **Viewport issues**: Ensure proper mobile viewport meta tag is present

#### Deployment Synchronization
The `isbn-web` shortcut uses a separate directory (`/Users/nickcuskey/ISBN`):
- **Automated sync**: Run `./sync_to_isbn.sh` to sync all changes automatically
- **Manual sync**: Copy updated files from development to deployment directory
- Key files to sync: `base.html`, `lot_details.html`, `lots_table.html`, `lots.py`, `service.py`
- Restart the server after synchronization

## Command Line Usage (isbn_lot_optimizer)
The toolkit also supports headless workflows. Representative examples:

```bash

# Database location (defaults to ~/.isbn_lot_optimizer/catalog.db)
python -m isbn_lot_optimizer --database ~/.isbn_lot_optimizer/catalog.db --no-gui --scan 978...
```

Available flags (selection):
- Core: `--database`, `--gui`/`--no-gui`, `--scan`, `--import`, `--condition`, `--edition`, `--skip-market`
- eBay: `--ebay-app-id`, `--ebay-global-id` (Finding; default `EBAY-US`), `--ebay-delay`, `--ebay-entries`

- Lots: `--refresh-lot-signals`, `--limit`
- Author tools: `--author-search`, `--author-threshold`, `--author-limit`, `--list-author-clusters`

## Series Enrichment & Lot Generation

The app provides comprehensive series tracking through two complementary systems:

### Hardcover API Integration

Integrates Hardcover's GraphQL search to detect and persist series information for individual books:

- **Environment**:
  - Set HARDCOVER_API_TOKEN to your Hardcover API token (include the "Bearer " prefix).
    - Example in .env:
      HARDCOVER_API_TOKEN=Bearer YOUR_TOKEN
- **Persistence**:
  - books table gains: series_name, series_slug, series_id_hardcover, series_position (REAL, preserves decimals like 0.5), series_confidence, series_last_checked.
  - series_peers table stores peer titles for a detected series (ordered by position when available, else title).
  - hc_cache caches API payloads (7 day TTL) to reduce repeat calls.
- **Rate limiting and retries**:
  - 1 request/second with burst of 5. Automatic backoff/retry on HTTP 429.
- **GUI**:
  - After a successful scan/import, a background thread enriches series for the new records and updates the DB; the detail pane can show a chip like "Series ¬∑ #position" when available.
- **CLI**:
  - Inline refresh from the main entrypoint:
    python -m isbn_lot_optimizer --refresh-series --limit 500
  - Standalone backfill script:
    python -m isbn_lot_optimizer.scripts.backfill_series --db ~/.isbn_lot_optimizer/catalog.db --limit 500 --only-missing --stale-days 30

Tip: If a book has no series in Hardcover, series_confidence remains 0 and series_last_checked is set so it won't be reprocessed immediately.

### BookSeries.org Integration

Enhanced series lots using comprehensive data from bookseries.org:

- **Data Source**:
  - Scraped 1,300+ authors, 12,770+ series, 104,465+ books from bookseries.org
  - Stored in `catalog.db` with tables: `authors`, `series`, `series_books`, `book_series_matches`
- **Intelligent Matching**:
  - Fuzzy text matching with normalized titles and author names
  - Confidence scoring (0.0-1.0) with auto-save for high-confidence matches (‚â•0.9)
  - Removes subtitles, articles, and punctuation for better matching
- **Series Lot Generation**:
  - Automatically creates lots grouped by series with completion tracking
  - Two strategy types:
    - `series_complete`: 100% complete series (e.g., "A Song Of Ice and Fire Series (5/5 Books)")
    - `series_incomplete`: <100% complete series (e.g., "Alex Cross Series (12/32 Books)")
  - Standardized naming convention: "Series Name (X/Y Books)" format
  - Shows which books you have vs. missing in lot justification
- **Web Interface**:
  - Filter checkboxes for Complete Series and Incomplete Series
  - Beautiful lot detail pages showing series completion with have/missing book lists
  - Purple-highlighted series information with position numbers
- **Scripts**:
  - `scripts/scrape_bookseries_org.py`: Scrape fresh data from bookseries.org
  - `scripts/import_series_data.py`: Import scraped JSON into database
  - `scripts/match_books_to_series.py`: Match existing books to series (43.6% match rate typical)

**Key Features**:
- Prevents duplicate lots: Enhanced series lots replace legacy series grouping
- Completion-aware naming: Lot names reflect completion status automatically
- Series position tracking: Shows book positions (e.g., "Have: #1, #2, #5" / "Missing: #3, #4")
- ISBN-based deduplication: Filters out incomplete legacy series lots when enhanced versions exist

## BooksRun Bulk Quotes (lothelper)
Fetch SELL quotes from BooksRun in bulk (requires `BOOKSRUN_KEY`):

```bash
# CSV -> CSV (default)
python -m lothelper booksrun-sell --in isbns.csv --out booksrun_sell_quotes.csv

# CSV -> Parquet
python -m lothelper booksrun-sell --in isbns.csv --out quotes.parquet --format parquet

# Tuning polite rate limits (sleep seconds between calls; default 0.2)
python -m lothelper booksrun-sell --in isbns.csv --out quotes.csv --sleep 0.1
```

The command reads an input CSV with an `isbn` column and writes either CSV or Parquet with per-ISBN results.

## Data & Caches
- Catalog DB (auto-created): `~/.isbn_lot_optimizer/catalog.db`
- Cover cache: `~/.isbn_lot_optimizer/covers/`
- eBay Browse OAuth token cache: `~/.isbn_lot_optimizer/ebay_bearer.json`
- Lot market snapshot cache: `~/.isbn_lot_optimizer/lot_cache.json`

## Development Notes
- Source lives in `isbn_lot_optimizer/`, `lothelper/`, and `isbn_web/`; see [Code Map](docs/development/codemap.md) for an overview.
- **Web Interface**: FastAPI application in `isbn_web/` with modern frontend stack
- Quick syntax check:
  ```bash
  python -m py_compile isbn_lot_optimizer/*.py
  python -m py_compile isbn_web/*.py
  ```
- Tests (pytest):
  ```bash
  pytest -q
  ```
- The GUI uses background threads for long-running operations. Any new service
  hooks should report progress through `_start_progress`, `_update_progress`,
  and `_finish_progress` to keep the status bar accurate.
- **Web Development**: The web interface uses HTMX for dynamic updates and Alpine.js for reactive components.
