## Test Suites Created

### 1. Profit Calculation Tests (`test_profit_calculations.py`)

**Purpose**: Validate profit calculation logic, fee calculations, and price estimation
**Test Count**: 20 tests
**Pass Rate**: 100%

#### Coverage Areas

**eBay Fee Calculations (4 tests)**:
- Standard price ($20): $3.53 fees ✓
- Low price ($5): $1.11 fees ✓
- High price ($100): $16.45 fees ✓
- Minimal price ($1): $0.46 fees ✓

**Amazon Fee Calculations (3 tests)**:
- Standard price ($20): $4.80 fees ✓
- Low price ($5): $2.55 fees (51% of sale) ✓
- High price ($100): $16.80 fees ✓

**Platform Comparison (1 test)**:
- eBay vs Amazon fee comparison across 5 price points ✓
- Result: eBay consistently lower fees at all price levels

**Profit Calculations (5 tests)**:
- Typical eBay sale: $11.47 profit ✓
- Typical Amazon sale: $10.20 profit ✓
- Marginal deal ($4.76): Below $5 threshold ✓
- Loss scenario: -$0.59 (negative profit) ✓
- Breakeven analysis: Both platforms positive but thin ✓

**Price Estimation (4 tests)**:
- Strong market data: Uses median/avg appropriately ✓
- Sparse data (2 sold): Falls back to baseline ✓
- No data (0 sold): Minimum baseline $3+ ✓
- Outlier handling: Prefers median over inflated average ✓

**Rarity Scoring (3 tests)**:
- High velocity (25 sold): Low rarity 0.06 ✓
- Low velocity (2 sold): Higher rarity 0.25 ✓
- No data (0 sold): Default rarity 0.5 ✓

#### Key Functions Tested
- `calculate_ebay_fees()` - 13.25% final value + 2.9% + $0.30 processing
- `calculate_amazon_fees()` - 15% referral + $1.80 closing
- `calculate_profit()` - Net profit after fees and cost basis
- `estimate_price()` - Multi-factor price estimation from metadata and market
- `compute_rarity()` - Rarity score based on active/unsold count

#### Insights Discovered
1. eBay fees are consistently lower than Amazon across all price points
2. Low-priced books (<$10) have fees as high as 51% of sale price on Amazon
3. Price estimation handles NULL data gracefully with minimum $3 baseline
4. Outlier detection works by favoring median over average prices

### 2. Database TTS Persistence Tests (`test_database_tts.py`)

**Purpose**: Validate Time-to-Sell (TTS) data persistence in SQLite database
**Test Count**: 9 tests
**Pass Rate**: 100%

#### Coverage Areas

**Schema Validation (1 test)**:
- Verified `time_to_sell_days` column exists in both `books` and `ebay_market` tables ✓

**Storage Tests (3 tests)**:
- Books table TTS storage: 30 days ✓
- Market table TTS storage: 18 days (calculated from 5 sold) ✓
- NULL TTS storage: Handles None gracefully ✓

**Retrieval Tests (1 test)**:
- Multiple books: Retrieved 7, 45, 180, and 365 day values correctly ✓

**Legacy Record Handling (2 tests)**:
- NULL TTS for legacy records: Graceful handling ✓
- Backward compatibility: Mixed NULL/populated TTS in same query ✓
- Update legacy record: NULL → 45 days successful ✓

**Update Tests (2 tests)**:
- Market data change: 5 sold (18 days) → 10 sold (9 days) ✓
- Bulk recalculation: Updated 5 records with correct TTS values ✓

#### Key Scenarios Tested
1. **Fresh inserts** with TTS calculated
2. **Legacy records** without TTS (NULL)
3. **Mixed queries** with both NULL and populated TTS
4. **Updates** when market data changes
5. **Bulk operations** recalculating multiple books

#### Database Schema Changes Validated
```sql
ALTER TABLE books ADD COLUMN time_to_sell_days INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE ebay_market ADD COLUMN time_to_sell_days INTEGER;
```

#### Insights Discovered
1. Database handles NULL TTS values correctly (backward compatible)
2. TTS persists correctly in both `books` and `ebay_market` tables
3. Bulk recalculation works efficiently for multiple records
4. Legacy data can coexist with new TTS-enhanced records

---

### 3. Edge Case Tests (`test_edge_cases.py`)

**Purpose**: Validate robustness with NULL data, boundaries, and extreme values
**Test Count**: 19 tests
**Pass Rate**: 100%

#### Coverage Areas

**NULL and Missing Data (4 tests)**:
- Complete NULL market: Returns None gracefully ✓
- Partial market data: Calculates TTS with just sold_count ✓
- Empty metadata: Falls back to minimum $3 baseline ✓
- Missing ISBN: TTS calculation still works ✓

**Boundary Value Testing (4 tests)**:
- TTS minimum (100 sold): Caps at 7 days ✓
- TTS maximum (0 sold): Caps at 365 days ✓
- TTS at 180-day threshold: Correctly identifies slow books ✓
- Zero values everywhere: Still produces valid estimate ✓

**Extreme Values (3 tests)**:
- Very high sold count (10,000): Correctly caps at 7 days ✓
- Very high price ($5,000 avg): Reflects in estimate ✓
- Negative values: Handles gracefully (doesn't crash) ✓

**Empty Collections (2 tests)**:
- No categories: Price estimation still works ✓
- No authors: Metadata handles empty tuple ✓

**Special Characters (2 tests)**:
- Unicode in title (文字 🎉): No encoding errors ✓
- Very long title (1000 chars): No truncation errors ✓

**Probability Score Boundaries (2 tests)**:
- Score classifications: Low <45, Medium 45-69, High ≥70 ✓
- No data scoring: Handles gracefully ✓

**Currency/Locale (2 tests)**:
- Non-USD currency (EUR): TTS calculates correctly ✓
- Missing currency (NULL): TTS still works ✓

#### Key Edge Cases Validated
1. **NULL safety**: All functions handle None inputs gracefully
2. **Boundary clamping**: TTS correctly caps at 7 and 365 days
3. **Extreme values**: No crashes with unrealistic data (10,000 sold, $9,999 prices)
4. **Encoding**: Unicode and special characters handled correctly
5. **Empty data**: Minimum baselines prevent $0 estimates

#### Insights Discovered
1. Functions are generally NULL-safe and defensive
2. TTS formula correctly clamps to 7-365 day range
3. Price estimation never goes below $3 minimum
4. Probability classification uses 0-100 scale (not 0.0-1.0)
5. Currency field not used in TTS calculation

---

## Key Findings and Insights

### 1. Fee Structure Analysis
- **eBay** is consistently cheaper than **Amazon** for books
- **Breakpoint**: At $100 sale price, fees converge (eBay $16.45 vs Amazon $16.80)
- **Low-price warning**: $5 books have 51% fees on Amazon (only $2.45 profit)

### 2. TTS Calculation Robustness
- Formula handles edge cases well (0 sold → 365 days, 100+ sold → 7 days)
- Correctly identifies slow-moving books (>180 days)
- Works with partial data (only needs `sold_count`)

### 3. Price Estimation Safeguards
- Never returns estimates below $3 (minimum baseline)
- Handles NULL market data by falling back to metadata-based estimates
- Prefers median over average to avoid outlier inflation

### 4. Database Backward Compatibility
- Legacy records with NULL TTS coexist with new records
- Queries work on mixed data without errors
- Bulk updates can backfill legacy records

### 5. NULL Safety Across Board
- All tested functions handle None/NULL inputs gracefully
- No crashes or exceptions with missing data
- Appropriate fallback values used (e.g., TTS → None, price → $3)

## Lessons Learned

### Testing Strategy
1. **Start with happy path**, then add edge cases
2. **Use realistic data values** (e.g., $5-$100 book prices)
3. **Test boundaries explicitly** (0, 1, max values)
4. **Validate NULL handling** for all optional fields

### Common Pitfalls Encountered
1. **F-string format specifiers** can't contain conditionals
   - Fixed: Use ternary before format string
2. **Function signatures** must be checked (e.g., `estimate_price` needs metadata)
3. **Model field names** may differ from assumptions (e.g., `sold_avg_price` not `avg_sold_price`)
4. **Probability scores** use 0-100 scale, not 0.0-1.0

### Test Design Principles
1. **One assertion per concept** (don't over-assert)
2. **Clear test names** (describe what's being tested)
3. **Minimal test data** (only what's needed for the test)
4. **Cleanup after tests** (temp databases deleted)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Implement buy/skip decision branch tests** (highest impact)
2. **Add series completion logic tests** (strategic value)
3. **Run existing + new tests in CI/CD** (prevent regressions)

### Medium-Term Improvements
4. **Add integration tests** (scan → evaluate → decide workflow)
5. **Real-world validation suite** (sample production data)
6. **Performance benchmarks** (track decision latency over time)

### Long-Term Enhancements
7. **Property-based testing** (generate random test data, verify invariants)
8. **Mutation testing** (verify tests catch real bugs)
9. **Coverage reporting** (automated metrics in CI/CD)
